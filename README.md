OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT
Project Develop a tool to assess the strength of passwords entered by users. Implement
algorithms to analyze factors such as length, complexity, and uniqueness to provide
feedback on password strength.

The objective of this project is to develop a tool that evaluates the strength of passwords entered by users. The tool will implement algorithms to analyze key factors such as length, complexity, and uniqueness to provide comprehensive feedback on password strength. This will enhance security by encouraging users to create more robust passwords.

Key Features
Length Analysis

Assess the total number of characters in the password.
Provide feedback on whether the password meets minimum length requirements for security.
Complexity Analysis

Check for the inclusion of various character types (uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters).
Evaluate the distribution and variety of characters to ensure a higher level of complexity.
Uniqueness Analysis

Compare the password against common passwords and patterns.
Ensure the password does not contain easily guessable sequences or repeated characters.![Screenshot 2024-07-31 132315](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/50991439-58f2-44d1-bdde-bb5af5490640)
